# gh-readmes
A tool to download readmes ðŸ“ƒ

How to use:

```bash
cat repos.txt | gh-readmes
```

After that, readmes from each of the projects will be downloaded in the **readmes** folder, which will be created in the same location as the tool's execution.

## Installation

First, you'll need to [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Then run this command to download + compile travis-test:
```
go install github.com/edivangalindo/gh-readmes@latest
```

You can now run `~/go/bin/gh-readmes`. If you'd like to just run `gh-readmes` without the full path, you'll need to `export PATH="/go/bin/:$PATH"`. You can also add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file if you'd like this to persist.
